The data set contains three different categorical classes such as setosa, versicolor, virginica in addition with numeric entities like sepal length, 
sepal width, petal length and petal width of 150 iris flowers.
More details on the dataset available at: "UCI Machine Learning repository"

it can be used for classification and prediction â€“ to see which features of an iris can identify the flower as a certain type of iris.
 The values for length and width can be used to classify an iris into one of three iris types: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.
  Visually exploring this data also lets you see the grouping (clustering) of the records into these three different types of irises.
